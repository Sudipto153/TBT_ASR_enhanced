# TBT_ASR_enhanced
This is an enhanced ASR version of TBT attack method on DNNs. It can classify the given input images to a target class with more than 90% success rate with flipping only 10 bits.
The updates made to the original TBT model can be found at the bottom of the 'enhanced_attack.ipynb' file.
The particular implementation given in the code has been done for 'target class 7'. As can be seen, the ASR has improved to 96%. Similar results can be obtained with other target classes as well.
